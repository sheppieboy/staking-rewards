This project is a minimal example of a smart contract that rewards the users (depositors) for staking their token in the contract. This is a simplier example derived from Synthetix staking rewards. This contract assumes that the depositing tokens are ERC20 tokens and it only accepts the stakingToken input set in the constructor upon deployment. As well, the rewards token will be another ERC20 token and will set in the cosntructor upon deployment.
